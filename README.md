# ðŸŒ± GreenStamp

Proof that your green actions matter â€” AI-verified, blockchain-backed, and publicly visible.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Features

### File Upload
- Upload images and videos as proof of your green actions
- Files are stored locally in the `public/uploads` directory
- Unique filenames are generated to prevent conflicts
- File metadata is displayed after successful upload

### Current Implementation
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage in `public/uploads/`
- **File Types**: Images and videos (as specified in the file input)
- **Security**: Unique filename generation with timestamp and random ID
- **UI**: Clean, responsive interface with upload progress feedback

## File Upload Flow

1. Navigate to `/submit` page
2. Select an image or video file
3. Click "Upload Proof"
4. File is saved to `public/uploads/` with a unique name
5. Success message shows file details and a link to view the uploaded file

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation uses local file storage. For production, consider:

- **IPFS Integration**: Upload files to IPFS for decentralized storage
- **Blockchain Integration**: Store file hashes on blockchain for immutability
- **AI Verification**: Add AI-powered verification of green actions
- **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and proof management
- **Database**: Store metadata in a database for better organization
